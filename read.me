response = athena.talk('Tell me a joke, Athena.')
print(response)  # Output: "Why did the AI go to therapy? It had too many neural issues!"

# Ask Athena for insights on a cryptocurrency
crypto_insight = athena.analyze_crypto('Bitcoin')
print(crypto_insight)  # Output: "Bitcoin's current trend suggests ..."
